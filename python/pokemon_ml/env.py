"""The Rust training environment, from Python.

`Env` holds many games and the arrays their observations are written into.
Observation `2 * game + side` is that side's view of that game:

    f     float32 [2·envs, OBS_F]   features (field, Pokémon, positions, moves)
    i     int16   [2·envs, OBS_I]   ids to embed, and four numbers about the decision
    mask  uint8   [2·envs, OBS_M]   legal actions

`LAYOUT` says where each named part lies (`LAYOUT["f"]["mon_feats"]` is an
offset and a shape) and `TABLES` holds static data for the model: a row of
features for every species, move and item id. The Rust side documents what
every number means (`src/obs.rs`, `src/env.rs`).
