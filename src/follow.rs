//! Follows a battle on Pokémon Showdown from what one player is sent, and
//! turns it into the observation a model was trained on.
//!
//! In training the observation is written from the simulator's own state
//! ([`crate::obs`]). On Showdown there is no such state: a player gets a log
//! of what happens, line by line, and at every decision a request listing
//! its own Pokémon and what it may do. [`Follower`] takes those two in and
//! keeps what they add up to: who stands where, stat stages, the conditions
//! each Pokémon and side is under and for how long, what each of the other
//! side's Pokémon has shown, and what the order of moves says of its Speed.
//! From that it rebuilds a [`Battle`] that is right in everything the
//! observation reads, and writes the observation and the legal actions from
//! it with the same code the training games use.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use vgc_engine::follow::Follower;
//! # use vgc_engine::env::OBS_M;
//! # use vgc_engine::obs::{OBS_F, OBS_I};
//! # let (team, side) = (Vec::new(), 0);
//! let mut me = Follower::new(side, team).unwrap();
//! let (mut f, mut i, mut mask) = (vec![0.0; OBS_F], vec![0; OBS_I], vec![0; OBS_M]);
//! // For every message of the battle room: the log lines, then the request.
//! me.line("|turn|1").unwrap();
//! me.request(r#"{"active":[],"side":{"pokemon":[]}}"#).unwrap();
//! if me.observe(&mut f, &mut i, &mut mask).unwrap() > 1 {
//!     // ...a model picks `actions` from the observation...
//!     let reply = me.choice([0, 46]).unwrap(); // "move 1, pass"
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `tests/follow.rs` checks it against recorded Showdown battles: at every
//! decision, the observation rebuilt from the log and the request must be
//! the one the simulator gives for the same battle.
//!
//! # What cannot be had from the log
//!
//! A few things the simulator knows are not said anywhere, and the
//! observation leaves them out for both sides so that training and play see
//! the same: conditions the game keeps to itself (a Choice lock, a flinch
//! waiting to happen), and the exact turns a rampage has left.
//!
//! # Where it and the simulator part
//!
//! Showdown keeps one thing from the last Pokémon of a side to choose: that
//! it is barred from a move or from switching by something not yet shown (a
//! foe's Imprison, a Shadow Tag that has not announced itself). It lists the
//! choice all the same, refuses it if it is made, and sends the request
//! again put right. The follower offers what Showdown lists, and takes the
//! corrected request like any other; the simulator, in training, does not
//! offer the choice in the first place.
//!
//! Two things it is not told, and so cannot always have right:
//!
//! - *What a move with no target on show paid to Pressure.* A Counter or a
//!   Mirror Coat that fails, or a move called by another that does nothing
//!   to be seen, was aimed at one of the other side picked at random, and
//!   the log does not say which. Facing one Pokémon with Pressure and one
//!   without, the follower cannot know whether a second PP went, and counts
//!   none. Every request gives the PP of the two on the field, so this
//!   stays wrong only for a Pokémon that left the field, or fainted, in
//!   that same turn.
//! - *That a move of the other side's never began*, when the Choice item
//!   that held it back has never been shown. A Pokémon held to one move can
//!   come to choose another (a Magic Room had its item switched off when it
//!   chose, and ended before it moved). Showdown shows the move and that it
//!   failed, like any move that fails. Where the item is known (its own
//!   Pokémon; the other side's on an open sheet, or once seen) the
//!   follower knows the move was never used. Where it is not, it takes it
//!   for the move that Pokémon last used, and the simulator knows better.
