//! Follows a battle on Pokémon Showdown from what one player is sent, and
//! turns it into the observation a model was trained on.
//!
//! In training the observation is written from the simulator's own state
//! ([`crate::obs`]). On Showdown there is no such state: a player gets a log
//! of what happens, line by line, and at every decision a request listing
//! its own Pokémon and what it may do. [`Follower`] takes those two in and
//! keeps what they add up to: who stands where, stat stages, the conditions
//! each Pokémon and side is under and for how long, what each of the other
//! side's Pokémon has shown, and what the order of moves says of its Speed.
//! From that it rebuilds a [`Battle`] that is right in everything the
//! observation reads, and writes the observation and the legal actions from
//! it with the same code the training games use.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use vgc_engine::follow::Follower;
//! # use vgc_engine::env::OBS_M;
//! # use vgc_engine::obs::{OBS_F, OBS_I};
//! # let (team, side) = (Vec::new(), 0);
//! let mut me = Follower::new(side, team).unwrap();
//! let (mut f, mut i, mut mask) = (vec![0.0; OBS_F], vec![0; OBS_I], vec![0; OBS_M]);
//! // For every message of the battle room: the log lines, then the request.
//! me.line("|turn|1").unwrap();
//! me.request(r#"{"active":[],"side":{"pokemon":[]}}"#).unwrap();
//! if me.observe(&mut f, &mut i, &mut mask).unwrap() > 1 {
//!     // ...a model picks `actions` from the observation...
//!     let reply = me.choice([0, 46]).unwrap(); // "move 1, pass"
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `tests/follow.rs` checks it against recorded Showdown battles: at every
//! decision, the observation rebuilt from the log and the request must be
//! the one the simulator gives for the same battle.
//!
//! # What cannot be had from the log
//!
//! A few things the simulator knows are not said anywhere, and the
//! observation leaves them out for both sides so that training and play see
//! the same: conditions the game keeps to itself (a Choice lock, a flinch
//! waiting to happen), and the exact turns a rampage has left.
