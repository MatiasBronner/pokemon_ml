//! What a player sees, as arrays: the input to a model.
//!
//! One observation is one side's view of a game at a decision, written into
//! three flat buffers that a caller owns (so that thousands can be filled in
//! place, in parallel, with nothing allocated):
//!
//! * `f32` features, [`OBS_F`] of them: the field, twelve Pokémon, the four
//!   positions on the field and the eight moves the side's own two can pick;
//! * `i16` ids, [`OBS_I`]: species, items, abilities and moves as table
//!   indices for an embedding to look up, and four numbers about the decision;
//! * `u8` masks, [`OBS_M`]: which actions are legal (see [`crate::env`]).
//!
//! [`layout`] says where each part lies. The side's own team is given in
//! full. Of the other side it is given what [`crate::shown`] has: what Team
//! Preview and the team sheets said, and what the battle has shown since.
//! Nothing is read from the opponent's Pokémon beyond that, bar what is in
//! plain sight on the field (stat stages, the conditions a Pokémon is under).
//!
//! The Pokémon come in the order their teams were registered: the viewer's
//! six, then the opponent's six. An opposing Pokémon that has appeared is
//! put where the Pokémon it appears to be was registered
//! ([`crate::shown::ShownMon::listed`]), so a token is one Pokémon from Team
//! Preview to the end.
//!
//! # Ids
//!
//! An id of 0 is "nothing here", 1 is "there is something and the viewer
//! does not know what", and a table index `k` is given as `k + 2`. So item
//! `2` is "holds nothing" (the item table's first entry) while item `1` is
//! "holds something unknown, or nothing".
//!
//! # Speed
//!
//! Each Pokémon comes with the lowest and highest its Speed can be and what
//! is known of an item that changes it, and each position with who goes first
//! against each position across the field. For the viewer's own Pokémon
//! these are facts. For the other side's they are what the order of moves has
//! left possible ([`crate::speed`]).
//!
//! # Timers
//!
//! How long a weather, a terrain or a screen has left is not public: an item
//! the viewer may not have seen makes them last 8 turns for 5. How long they
//! have been up is, and that is what is given ([`Timers`]). Conditions no
//! item extends (Trick Room, Tailwind) are given by the turns they have left.
