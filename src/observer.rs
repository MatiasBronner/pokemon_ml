//! Reads Pokémon Showdown's battle log and keeps track of what it has shown
//! about each Pokémon: the same knowledge [`Battle::shown`](crate::Battle::shown)
//! reports, worked out from the text a player receives instead of from the
//! simulator's state.
//!
//! It has two uses. Recorded battles carry Showdown's log, and at every
//! decision the engine's idea of what has been shown must equal what this
//! reader makes of the log (`difftest --shown`). And a program playing on
//! Showdown has only the log to go by: this is the reader it needs.
//!
//! ```
//! use vgc_engine::observer::Observer;
//!
//! let mut seen = Observer::new();
//! for line in [
//!     "|switch|p1a: Rex|Garchomp, L50, M|100/100",
//!     "|switch|p2a: Milotic|Milotic, L50, F|100/100",
//!     "|move|p1a: Rex|Earthquake|p2a: Milotic",
//!     "|-damage|p2a: Milotic|41/100",
//!     "|-damage|p1a: Rex|90/100|[from] item: Life Orb",
//! ] {
//!     seen.line(line).unwrap();
//! }
//! let rex = seen.shown(0).active[0].clone().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!((rex.moves, rex.item.as_deref(), rex.hp), (vec!["earthquake".to_string()], Some("lifeorb"), 90));
//! ```
//!
//! Lines are the ones every player and spectator receives. Where Showdown
//! sends a private and a public version of a line (`|split|`), give this the
//! public one, or hand the raw log to [`Observer::lines`], which picks it.
//!
//! # Who a line is about
//!
//! A line that names an ability or an item also names one or two Pokémon,
//! and Showdown has no single rule for which of them has it:
//! `|-damage|p1a: A|…|[from] item: Rocky Helmet|[of] p2a: B` is B's helmet,
//! while `|-heal|p1a: A|…|[from] item: Shell Bell|[of] p2a: B` is A's bell.
//! [`holder`] is the table of which is which. It was drawn up by asking
//! Showdown itself, on every such line of some 20,000 battles, which of the
//! Pokémon mentioned really had the thing (`oracle/gen_cases.js --holders`).
