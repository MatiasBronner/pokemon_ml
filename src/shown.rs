//! What a battle has shown about each Pokémon.
//!
//! The engine knows everything: every move, item, ability and exact HP on
//! both sides. A player does not. This module keeps, for every Pokémon, what
//! everyone watching the battle has been told about it, and
//! [`Battle::shown`] hands that out:
//!
//! ```
//! use vgc_engine::{Battle, Choice, PokemonSet};
//!
//! let set = |species: &str, moves: &[&str]| PokemonSet::from_names(species, moves, "Hardy", [0; 6]).unwrap();
//! let ours = [
//!     set("Incineroar", &["Fake Out", "Flare Blitz"]).ability("Intimidate").unwrap(),
//!     set("Garchomp", &["Earthquake", "Protect"]).item("Life Orb").unwrap(),
//!     set("Milotic", &["Scald"]),
//! ];
//! let theirs = [set("Sylveon", &["Hyper Voice"]), set("Arcanine", &["Protect"]), set("Snorlax", &["Body Slam"])];
//! let mut battle = Battle::new([&ours, &theirs], [1, 2, 3, 4]).unwrap();
//!
//! // Before anyone has moved: the leads are on the field, a third Pokémon has
//! // not been seen, and the only thing learned is the ability that announced itself.
//! let shown = battle.shown(0);
//! assert_eq!(shown.unseen, 1);
//! let incineroar = shown.active[0].as_ref().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(incineroar.ability.as_deref(), Some("intimidate"));
//! assert!(incineroar.moves.is_empty());
//! let garchomp = shown.active[1].as_ref().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!((garchomp.item.as_deref(), garchomp.ability.as_deref()), (None, None));
//!
//! // Garchomp uses Earthquake: now that move is known, and so is the Life Orb that hurt it.
//! let protect = Choice::Move { slot: 0, target: 0, mega: false };
//! let fake_out = Choice::Move { slot: 0, target: 1, mega: false };
//! battle.choose([[fake_out, protect], [protect, protect]]).unwrap();
//! let shown = battle.shown(0);
//! let garchomp = shown.active[1].as_ref().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(garchomp.moves, ["earthquake"]);
//! assert_eq!(garchomp.item.as_deref(), Some("lifeorb"));
//! ```
//!
//! "Shown" means exactly what Pokémon Showdown's battle log says, and the
//! engine is checked against a reader of that log ([`crate::observer`]) at
//! every decision of every recorded battle. What follows from that:
//!
//! * Nothing is worked out. A move that did less damage than it should have
//!   does not reveal an Assault Vest, a Pokémon that outsped another does not
//!   reveal a Choice Scarf, and a Frisk that found nothing does not reveal an
//!   empty hand. Only what the log names counts.
//! * Everything the log names counts, including lines a player's screen does
//!   not dwell on: in Champions a Regenerator heals with a line of its own
//!   when it leaves, and Natural Cure says what it cured.
//! * Under Illusion, what the disguised Pokémon shows is credited to the
//!   Pokémon it is disguised as, since that is who everyone thinks it is.
//!   When the disguise breaks, what was shown since it came in moves over to
//!   the Pokémon it really is. A disguise that is never broken is never
//!   corrected.
//! * HP is the percentage Showdown reports (rounded down, never 0 for a
//!   Pokémon that has not fainted), with the colour of the bar.
//! * In one place the plain reading would be wrong, and is not followed. A
//!   move borrowed with Copycat can carry on over the next turns (Uproar,
//!   Fly), and a line that then names it, because Disable or a Choice item
//!   stopped it, reads as if the move were the Pokémon's own. The first such
//!   line after a borrowing is passed over.
//!
//! What is public anyway is not repeated here: stat stages, volatile
//! conditions, the weather and each side's conditions are in the [`Battle`]
//! itself. (Their timers are not public, though: the turns a Reflect has
//! left give away a Light Clay.) PP is not tracked.
//!
//! # Before the battle: Team Preview and team sheets
//!
//! Some things are known before anything is shown. Team Preview lists the
//! species each player registered, and with open team sheets, which
//! Showdown's Champions formats offer and force in a best-of-three, each
//! player also has the other's sheet: every registered Pokémon's item,
//! ability, moves and nature. [`Battle::with_rosters`] says what was
//! registered and whether the sheets are open, and [`ShownSide::roster`]
//! hands it out. A Pokémon that has been seen points at the entry it appears
//! to be ([`ShownMon::listed`]).
//!
//! The sheet and the record are kept apart: the sheet is what a Pokémon came
//! with, the record what the battle has shown of it since. What stays hidden
//! with open sheets is the stat points, and which of the registered Pokémon
//! were brought.
//!
//! # Illusion
//!
//! "The entry it appears to be" is as far as it goes on a team with an
//! Illusion Pokémon, which comes in looking like a team-mate.
//! [`ShownSide::illusion`] lists the registered Pokémon that have Illusion,
//! as far as their opponent can know, and [`ShownMon::maybe_disguise`] marks
//! every Pokémon that might be one of them in disguise. The mark comes off
//! only when that is ruled out: the Illusion Pokémon has fainted, or has
//! stood on the field as itself beside the Pokémon in question. Nothing
//! cleverer is tried (a move that is on one sheet and not the other): that
//! is inference, and left to whoever reads the record.
