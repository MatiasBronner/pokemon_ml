//! What the order of moves has shown about each Pokémon's Speed.
//!
//! A player never sees the other side's Speed, but sees who moves first, and
//! knows its own Pokémon's Speed exactly. So every time one of theirs and one
//! of its own move in the same priority bracket, it learns which is faster.
//! [`Speeds`] keeps what follows from that, for every Pokémon of both teams
//! as the other side knows it.
//!
//! # What is kept
//!
//! Not a range of numbers but the set of ways the Pokémon can have been
//! built that are still possible: every combination of
//!
//! * the 33 amounts of stat points it can have in Speed (0 to 32),
//! * the three things its nature can do to Speed (lower, nothing, raise),
//! * the three things its item can do (nothing, Choice Scarf, Iron Ball).
//!
//! It starts as everything the rules allow (narrowed by an open team sheet,
//! which gives nature and item) and each observation strikes out the
//! combinations that would have moved in the other order. A range of Speed
//! follows from the set ([`Speeds::range`]); so does "it must be holding a
//! Choice Scarf", when nothing else is left that explains what was seen.
//! Because the set is about how the Pokémon was built and not about a
//! number, Mega Evolution needs nothing special: the same points and nature
//! give the new forme's Speed.
//!
//! Items narrow it as well. An item that shows itself is the Pokémon's one
//! item, so it rules out the other two classes. And under the regulation's
//! item clause a team has each item once: when one Pokémon is found to have
//! been registered with the Choice Scarf (it is proved to hold one, or loses
//! one, having been handed nothing), the Scarf is struck from every
//! team-mate that still holds what it was registered with.
//!
//! # What counts as an observation
//!
//! When a move starts, it was at the head of the queue, which Showdown sorts
//! by priority and then by Speed as things stand at that moment (re-sorted
//! after every action). So it was at least as fast as every move of the same
//! priority still waiting. That is used when both moves go on to be named in
//! the log (a Pokémon that flinches does not show what it chose, and so not
//! its priority), and when everything else that enters the comparison is
//! public: stat stages, paralysis, Tailwind, Trick Room, the weather or
//! terrain an ability reads.
//!
//! It is passed over whenever something the watcher has not been shown could
//! be at work: an ability the Pokémon might legally have that changes Speed
//! or priority in the conditions of the moment (Swift Swim in rain, Prankster
//! on a status move, Stall, Unburden once the item is gone, Klutz), a
//! Pokémon that may be an Illusion or has transformed, a Speed Swap. A
//! comparison passed over costs a little knowledge; one wrongly used would
//! leave a set without the truth in it. `tests/speed.rs` plays thousands of
//! games with every legal ability and item and checks that it never does.
//!
//! Nothing here reads what the watcher has not been shown, bar the fields
//! marked as the truth, which only the self-check ([`Speeds::strict`]) reads.

// Natures, item classes and events are looked up by index in several arrays at once.
